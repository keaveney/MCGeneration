This package performs the essential steps of a large scale MC generation
with the MG5_aMC@NLO generator using the CMSSW framework and environment
and the DESY NAF batch system. 


The steps are:

1. Creation of 'gripack' tarball for a given process and modelling
containing the essential code for the genertaion of an aribtrary number
of parton-level events.
   -> performed with 'gridpack_generation.sh'



2. Generation of parton-level events with the gridpack as input, subsequent
parton-shower and hadronisation (currently only set up for PYTHIA8) and
writing of 'GENSIM' files (CMSSW format).

   -> performed with 'base_me_ps.sh'


As one is typically interested in many theoretical scenarios, wrapper
scripts are used to perform multiple gridpack creations and parton-shower
+ hadronisation jobs for a pre-defined range of different model parameters. 

They are:
     ->submit_madpack_naf.sh
     ->submit_me_ps.sh
